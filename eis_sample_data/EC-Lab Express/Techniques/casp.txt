Constant Amplitude Sinusoidal micro Potentio polarization (CASP) is a technique used to determine the corrosion current and theTafel coefficients. In this technique, a sinusoidal voltage is applied around a potential (Ei) with a small amplitude (Va) and a constant low frequency (fs).Thanks to a Direct Fourier Transform,  the amplitudes of the fundamental frequency (fs), 1st (2 fs) and 2nd (3 fs) harmonics are determined and used to calculate the corrosion current and the Tafel coefficients. This technique was designed to be faster than the usual linear polarization around the corrosion potential and, compared to the Tafel fit, does not require an adjustment of the Tafel parameters to have access to Icorr .
