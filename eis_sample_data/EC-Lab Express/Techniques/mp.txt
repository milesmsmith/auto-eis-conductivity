The Modular pulse technique (MOD) allows the user to control successively in different sequences the current and/or the voltage of the cell. With this technique including galvanostatic and potentiostatic sequences, the switch from one mode to the other is very fast. The recording conditions included in the sequence (rc) offer the possibility to record only few sequences in a long time experiment. This technique is particularly useful for electrochemical coating.
