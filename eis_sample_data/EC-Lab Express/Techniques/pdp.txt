Pitting corrosion occurs when discrete areas of a material undergo rapid attack while the vast majority of the surface remains virtually unaffected. The basic requirement for pitting is the existence of a passive state for the material in the environment of interest. Pitting of a given material depends strongly upon the presence of an aggressive species in the environment and a sufficiently oxidizing potential.

This technique corresponds to the pitting potential determination of a material, using a potential sweep.The experiment stops when a pitting current (Ip) defined by the user is reached. Ip can be used as a safety parameter in order to avoid damages on the working electrode.
