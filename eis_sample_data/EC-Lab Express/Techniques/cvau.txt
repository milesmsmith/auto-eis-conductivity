The CV Linear technique allows the user to perform a voltage scan using the analog scan generator option of the potentiostat. When this technique and this option are used, a true analog voltage scan (not a staircase scan) between two vertex potentials (E1 and E2) is applied to the system. This analog characteristic of the voltage scan avoids any transient currents to the system. This option can be coupled with the hardware ohmic drop compensation. So, experiments with fast scan rate and ohmic drop compensation can be performed. This allows one to detect electroactive species with short lifetime in resistive medium. When the recording timebase (dt) is below 15 µs the instrument switches to a fast acquisition mode allowing data points to be recorded at every 1 µs. In this specific mode averaging and auto-ranging are disabled.
