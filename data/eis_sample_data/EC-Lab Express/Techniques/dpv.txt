DPV is very useful technique for analytical determination (for example metal ion quantification in a sample). The differential measurements discriminate faradic current from capacitive one. 

In this technique, the applied waveform is the sum of a pulse train and a staircase from the initial potential (Ei) to a final potential (Ef). The current is sampled just before the pulse and near the end of the pulse. The resulting current is the difference between these two currents. It has a relatively flat baseline. The current peak height is directly related to the concentration of the electroactive species in the electrochemical cell.
