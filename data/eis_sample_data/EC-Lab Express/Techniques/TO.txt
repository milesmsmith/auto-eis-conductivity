The 'Trigger Out' technique can be used to synchronize a potentiostat channel with an external instrument. A trigger out pulse is generated by the potentiostat during the technique placed after the 'Trigger Out' technique. The pulse duration and level can be programmed by the user. The pulse cannot last more than the next technique duration. Before and after the pulse the potentiostat drives the trigger out signal to the default level set by the 'Trigger Out Set' technique.
