The Potentio Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy on Stack (STACK PEIS) technique performs impedance measurements into potentiostatic mode in applying a sinus around a DC potential E that can be set to a fixed value or relatively to the cell equilibrium potential.

For very capacitive or low impedance electrochemical systems, the potential amplitude can lead to a current overflow that can stop the experiment in order to protect the unit from overheating. Using STACK GEIS instead of STACK PEIS can avoid this inconvenient situation.

Moreover, during corrosion experiment, a potential shift of the electrochemical system can occur. STACK PEIS technique can lead to impedance measurements far from the corrosion potential while STACK GEIS can be performed at a zero current.
