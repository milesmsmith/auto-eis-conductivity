To perform investigations on multi electrode Array (MEA) with Mp-MEA multiplexer, electrochemical techniques have to be include between two dedicated techniques 'Mux' and 'Mux loop'. 'Mux' allows the user to select the MEA design among MEA offered in the library and then select the electrode of interest. 'Mux loop' is the technique which controls the multiplexing (electrode to the next one).
