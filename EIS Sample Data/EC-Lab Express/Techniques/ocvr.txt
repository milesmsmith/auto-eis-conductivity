The Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) technique consists of a period during which no potential or current is applied to the working electrode. The cell is disconnected from the power amplifier. On the cell, the potential measurement is available. So the evolution of the rest potential can be recorded. This period is commonly used as preconditioning time or for equilibration of the electrochemical cell.
