Originally introduced as a polarographic technique (performed at a DME), the Differential Normal Pulse Voltammetry is a sensitive electroanalytical technique very close to the DPV technique with a pulsed potential sweep. The potential pulse is swept from an initial potential Ei to a final potential Ef. There are two main differences with the DPV technique: first the pulse waveform is made with a prepulse (SH amplitude with PPW duration) before the pulse (PH amplitude with PW duration) and second the potential always comes back to the initial potential (Ei) after the pulsed sequence. Ei is assumed to be the potential where no faradic reaction occurs. The plotted current is the difference of both currents measured at the end of the pulse (I forward) and at the end of the prepulse (I reverse).

This technique is often used in polarography and by biologists to define the most appropriate potential for the electrochemical detection to a fixed potential with the DPA technique.
