The loop technique has been built to repeat all or a part of an experiment made with several linked techniques. The user has to define the technique number Ne where he wants to go back to (Ne = 1 for the first technique of the experiment). Then all the techniques linked after the selected one will be repeated. The user has to choose the number of time nt that the experiment will be looped. An experiment with nt = 2 will have three loops.
