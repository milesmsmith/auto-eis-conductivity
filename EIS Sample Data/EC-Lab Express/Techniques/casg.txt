Constant Amplitude Sinusoidal micro Galvano polarization  (CASG) is a technique similar than CASP. But in that case, the perturbation is performed  around an initial current (Ii)  with a small amplitude (Ia) and a constant low frequency (fs).Thanks to a Direct Fourier Transform the amplitudes of the fundamental frequency (fs), 1st (2 fs) and 2nd (3 fs) harmonics are determined. This technique can also be used for other applications such as battery, fuel cell, …
