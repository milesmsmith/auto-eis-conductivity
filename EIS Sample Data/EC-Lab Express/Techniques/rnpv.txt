The Reverse Normal Pulse Voltammetry is a derivative technique from the NPV. The main difference is that the initial (base) potential Ei is placed in the diffusion-limited region for electrolysis of the species present in the bulk solution. The pulses are made through the region where the species in solution is not electroactive. 

The RNPV experiment involves a significant faradic current. This method is a reversal experiment because of the detection of the product from a prior electrolysis.'
