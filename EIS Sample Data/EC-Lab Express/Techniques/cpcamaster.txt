CP/CA bipotentiostat technique allows the user to perform ChronoPotentiometry (CP) technique on one electrode and ChronoAmperometry (CA) technique on another electrode. One technique controls two channels of the bipotentiostat. And both channels techniques are synchronized (start and stop in the meantime and same sampling rate). This bipotentiostat technique is especially dedicated to Ring Rotating Disk Electrode (RRDE) investigations.
