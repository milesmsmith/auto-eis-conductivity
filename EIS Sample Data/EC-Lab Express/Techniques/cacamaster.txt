CA/CA bipotentiostat technique allows the user to perform ChronoAmperometry (CA) technique on one electrode and another CA technique on the second electrode. One technique controls two channels of the bipotentiostat. And both channels techniques are synchronized (start and stop in the meantime and same sampling rate). This bipotentiostat technique is especially dedicated to Ring Rotating Disk Electrode (RRDE) investigations.
