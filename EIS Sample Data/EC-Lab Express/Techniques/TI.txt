The 'Trigger In' technique can be used to synchronize a potentiostat channel with an external instrument. The potentiostat waits an external trigger to continue the experiment with the technique set after the 'Trigger In' technique. Before receiving the trigger the potentiostat goes to the next technique control mode. The trigger in signal is level sensitive and can be set to be either logic low or high. For the potentiostat to recognize the trigger a pulse must be set and held for a minimum of 100 µs.
