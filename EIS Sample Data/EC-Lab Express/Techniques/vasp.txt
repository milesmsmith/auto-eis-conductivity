Variable Amplitude Sinusoidal micro Polarization (VASP) is a non linear EIS technique used as a corrosion technique to determine the corrosion current and the Tafel parameters. In this technique a potential sinusoidal wave is applied around the corrosion potential (Ecorr) with N amplitudes increasing from Vamin to Vamax. For each amplitude, the polarization resistance (Rp) is determined and Rp versus applied potential amplitude is plotted. A parametric identification is done on the curve in order to determine the corrosion current and the tafel parameters.
