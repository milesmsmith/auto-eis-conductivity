The Cyclic Potentiodynamic Polarization is often used to evaluate pitting susceptibility.It is the most common electrochemical test for localized corrosion resistance. The potential is swept in a single cycle or slightly less than one cycle. The size of the hysteresis is examined along with the difference between the values of the starting Open circuit corrosion potential and the return passivation potential. The existence of hysteresis is usually indicative of pitting, while the size of the loop is often related to the amount of pitting. This technique can be used to determine the pitting potential and the repassivation potential. 

This technique is based both on the PDP and PSP techniques. It begins with a potentiodynamic phase where the potential increases.This phase is limited either with a limit potential (EL) or with a pitting current (Ip) defined by the user. If the pitting current is not reached during the potentiodynamic phase, then a potentiostatic phase is applied until pitting (Ip is reached). Ip can be used as a safety parameter in order to avoid damages on the working electrode. Then an additional potentiodynamic phase is done as a reverse scan.
