The ohmic drop iRu is the voltage drop developed across the solution resistance Ru between the reference electrode and the working electrode, when current is flowing through. When the product iRu gets significant it introduces an important error in the control of the working electrode potential and should be compensated. 
 
The IR Determination with Galvanostatic Impedance (GZIR) technique utilizes Impedance measurements to determine the Ru Value. This technique applies a sinusoidal excitation around the DC current measured at the beginning of the technique. GZIR technique determines the solution resistance Ru, for one high frequency value, as the real part of the measured impedance. A percentage of the Ru value will be used to compensate next potentiostatic techniques. It is highly recommended to not exceed exceed 85% of the Ru measured value in order to avoid oscillations of the instrument. 

When used in linked techniques including loops, Ru value can change during the experiment. GZIR can be an ideal tool to do a dynamic ohmic drop compensation between repeated techniques. 
In the case of particular non-linear systems it can be necessary to use PZIR instead of GZIR.
