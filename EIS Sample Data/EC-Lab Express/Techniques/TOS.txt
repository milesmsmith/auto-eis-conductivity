The 'Trigger Out Set' technique can be used together with the 'Trigger Out' technique to synchronize the potentiostat with an external instrument. 'Trigger Out Set' technique sets the default level of the trigger out signal to be either at a logic low or high level. Before and after a pulse generated by the 'Trigger Out' technique the potentiostat drives the trigger out signal to the default level. The trigger out default level can be changed only by another execution of a 'Trigger Out Set' technique or by a power-up or reset of the potentiostat.
