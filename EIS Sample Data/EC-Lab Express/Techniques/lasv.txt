Large Amplitude Sinusoidal Voltammetry (LASV) is an electrochemical technique where the potential excitation of the working electrode is a large amplitude sinusoidal waveform. Similar to the cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique, it gives qualitative and quantitative information on redox processes. In contrast to the CV, the double layer capacitive current is not subject to sharp transitions at reverse potentials. Since the electrochemical systems are non-linear the current response exhibits higher order harmonics at large sinusoidal amplitudes. Valuable information can be found from data analysis in the frequency domain.
